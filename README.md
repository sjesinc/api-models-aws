This repository contains [Smithy](https://smithy.io/) models (in the
[JSON AST](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/json-ast.html) form) for all public AWS API services. Smithy is an open-source
interface definition language, set of code generators, and developer tools used to generate code for web services and 
client SDKs from API models. At AWS, we use Smithy extensively to model our service APIs and provide the daily releases
of the AWS SDKs and CLIs.

AWS API models can be helpful for a variety of uses cases such as building custom SDKs/CLIs SDKs for use with AWS or
implementing MCP servers to interact with AWS services.


## Directory Structure

The AWS models repository contains:

* One top-level directory per service
    * Top-level service directories are named using the `<sdk-id>` of the service, where `<sdk-id>` is the value of the
    model's [`sdkId`](https://smithy.io/2.0/aws/aws-core.html#sdkid), lowercased and with spaces converted to hyphens
* Each service directory contains one directory per `<version>` of the service, where `<version>` is the value of the
service shape's [version property](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/service-types.html#service)
* Contained within a service-version directory, a model file named `<sdk-id>-<version>.json` will be present
